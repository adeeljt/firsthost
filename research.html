            <h2>Origins of the Modern MOOC (xMOOC)</h2>
            <p>Online education has been around for decades, with many universities offering online courses to a small, limited audience. What changed in 2011 was scale and availability, when Stanford University offered three courses free to the public, each garnering signups of about 100,000 learners or more. The launch of these three courses, taught by Andrew Ng, Peter Norvig, Sebastian ...</p>

            <h2>Mechatronic design of an integrated robotic hand</h2>
            <p>Historically, robotic hand research has tended to focus on two areas: severely underactuated hands, and high-degree-of-freedom fully actuated hands. Comparatively little research has been done in between those spaces. Furthermore, despite the large number of robotic hand designs that have been proposed in the past few decades, very few robot hands are available for purchase ...</p>

            <h2>Deep Learning with COTS HPC Systems</h2>
            <p>Scaling up deep learning algorithms has been shown to lead to increased performance in benchmark tasks and to enable discovery of complex high-level features. Recent efforts to train extremely large networks (with over 1 billion parameters) have relied on cloud-like computing infrastructure and thousands of CPU cores. In this paper, we present technical details ...</p>

            <h2>Parsing with Compositional Vector Grammars</h2>
            <p>Natural language parsing has typically been done with small sets of discrete categories such as NP and VP, but this representation does not capture the full syntactic nor semantic richness of linguistic phrases, and attempts to improve on this by lexicalizing phrases or splitting categories only partly address the problem at the cost of huge ...</p>

            <h2>Learning New Facts From Knowledge Bases With Neural Tensor Networks and Semantic Word Vectors</h2>
            <p>Knowledge bases provide applications with the benefit of easily accessible, systematic relational knowledge but often suffer in practice from their incompleteness and lack of knowledge of new entities and relations. Much work has focused on building or extending them by finding patterns in large unannotated text corpora. In contrast, here we mainly aim to complete ...</p>
